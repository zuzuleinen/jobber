## About

**jobber** is a CLI tool for searching tech jobs in Berlin area. So far it searches a job 
based on your terms on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and [berlinstartupjobs.com](http://berlinstartupjobs.com/)
This tool is currently work in progress and just a way for me to learn Go.

When the project is finished, I will update this file with instructions to set-up the tool.
