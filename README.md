## About

**jobber** is a CLI tool for searching tech jobs in Berlin area. 

## How will it work
After install, the tool will search for jobs on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and [berlinstartupjobs.com](http://berlinstartupjobs.com/) based on your preferences. Once it finds a new job it will send it to your email.

Instructions for installing the tool will come once the project is completed(end of December).
